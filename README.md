# Goat

A Golang-based virtual dom.

Live demo https://goat-two.vercel.app/

## Steps to run locally
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/hdck007/goat.git`
2. navigate inside the repository `cd goat`
3. build wasm `GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o main.wasm -buildvcs=false`. Yes, it's a big command feel free to use npm scripts, or as in my case I have created an alias
4. Serve the HTML using some kind of HTTP server (I use the vscode live server extension currently)

> Note: I will soon develop a dev server for this
